In the godbolt link below there is a coda that defines a `Point` class, representing 2D points, with some
getters and setters. Then it defines a function called `distance`, that calculates the distance between
the two points.  
The code however doesn't compile. Try to find the bug and fix it.  

-Hint: In this case there are several errors.
