# Matrix transposition 
Write a function that transposes a matrix, represented as nested vectors.

BONUS:
1. Re-implement the solution using a 1D vector to represent the matrix.
NOTE: Is this representation better that the nested version? Why?
2. Generalize the solution using templates.
3. If possible, re-write the function using STL algorithms instead of raw loops.
