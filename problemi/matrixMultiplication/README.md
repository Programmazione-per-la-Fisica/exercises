# Matrix multiplication
Write a function that takes in input two matrices, implemented as nested vectors, and returns their product.

NOTE: What is the computational complexity of your function?

BONUS:
1. Re-implement the solution using a 1D vector to represent the matrix.
NOTE: Is this representation better that the nested version? Why?
2. Generalize the solution using templates.
