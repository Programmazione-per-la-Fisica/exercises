# Matrix sum
Write a function that takes in input two matrices of integers, implemented as nested vectors,
and returns their sum.

BONUS:
1. Re-implement the solution using a 1D vector to represent the matrix.
NOTE: Is this representation better that the nested version? Why?
2. Generalize the solution using templates.
