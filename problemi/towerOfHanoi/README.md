# Tower of Hanoi

The tower of Hanoi is a game where several disks of decreasing size are stacked one over the other around a rod, in order to form a tower. The goal of the game is to move the disks one at a time in order to move the tower from one rod to another. The only condition is that a larger disk can't be stacked on top of a smaller one.
Write a function that calculates the number of moves necessary to win the game in function of the number of disks.
