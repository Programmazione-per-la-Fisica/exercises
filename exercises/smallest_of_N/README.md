# Smallest of N numbers

Write a program that reads an arbitrary sequence of numbers from 
standard input and writes the smallest one to standard output.

- Hint 1: press `Ctrl-D` to tell the program there is nothing more to 
read from standard input
- Hint 2: the expression `std::cin.good()` tells if itâ€™s still possible 
to read something from `std::cin`
